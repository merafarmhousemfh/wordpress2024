                            <h3>Prof. AC Varshney Vision: Empowering Farmers with Trustworthy Livestock Information </h3><br>
                            <p>Prof. AC Varshney, Former Vice-Chancellor DUVASU, Mathura, UP and Former Dean CAU, Aizwal, Mizoram 
                            and CSKHPKV, Palampur, HP has worked in the livestock field for years. He always wants to revolutionise 
                            the agricultural landscape then he met Mr. Pawan Mangla, Chairman, MFH. After 2 to 3 meetings, he came
                             to know about the project idea of Mr. Mangla of creating a platform that provides reliable and transparent
                              information to farmers and he found that it was the best way to contribute to the farmer society.
                               He advised to add livestock information to the portal Mera Farmhouse to empower farmers as he earlier 
                               came across farmers who are not aware of the latest advancements in veterinary science, livestock 
                               management, and dairy farming machinery. He thought that this is the best way that can help in 
                               prosperity and the sustainable growth of the agricultural sector.</p>
                               <p>At the core of his vision lies trust and transparency. He aimed to build a platform where farmers can access authentic, verified, and unbiased information, creating a strong foundation of trust between us and the farming community. He wants that accurate information on vaccines, crossbreeding techniques, livestock breeds, disease prevention, and precautions, fostering an environment of credibility and dependability should be provided to the farmers. Our platform will consistently deliver reliable information that farmers can rely on for making critical decisions. By ensuring the scalability of our project, we aim to positively impact the lives of farmers from small-scale family-owned farms to large commercial enterprises.
                            </p><br>
                           <p>Recognising the diversity of farmers and their varying levels of technological familiarity, we have created a user-friendly platform that is easy to navigate and understand. Through a convenient interface, this portal will provide farmers with the tools which they need to enhance their farming practices and improve productivity.
                        </p><br>
                            <p>This project is a comprehensive repository of agricultural information, covering a wide range of topics from the latest machinery for dairy farming to innovative crossbreeding techniques. By providing farmers with knowledge about cost-effective livestock choices, preventive measures for diseases, and best practices, we aim to empower them to make informed decisions that can lead to higher yields and increased profitability.
                        </p><br>
                       <p>This has enriched our platform with cutting-edge research and advancements in agricultural science, ensuring that farmers receive the most up-to-date information and recommendations.
